# BlackWall
 A firefox browser extension to classify text on current webpage based on whether its AI generated or human written  
 Initially I wanted to add a function to black AI generated text out but my API access got instantly revoked due to the amount of requests this was making.  
 Would work pretty well with a paid api but its very expensive unfortunately.  
 Uploading regardless, hope it will help someone doing the same thing in the future or at least make people think about the amount of bots on social media and how many "news sites" are actually just AI generated crap.
